Here are some key features and benefits of WSL:

Linux Compatibility: WSL allows you to run native Linux command-line tools and utilities directly within Windows, including popular distributions like Ubuntu, Debian, and others.

Integration: You can seamlessly work with Windows files and directories from the Linux environment, and vice versa. This integration simplifies tasks like editing files, running scripts, or using development tools.

Performance: WSL 2, introduced with Windows 10 version 1903, offers significant performance improvements over the initial WSL release. It uses a lightweight virtual machine (VM) to run the Linux kernel, resulting in improved speed and compatibility.

Development: WSL is particularly useful for software developers who want to develop and test applications on both Windows and Linux platforms. It provides a consistent environment for development across different systems.

Package Management: You can use package managers like APT or YUM to install and manage software packages within the Linux distribution, just as you would on a native Linux system.

Command-Line Access: WSL provides access to a full-featured Linux terminal, which is useful for running command-line tools, scripting, and managing servers and services.

Customization: You can install different Linux distributions from the Microsoft Store, customize your WSL environment, and use it for various tasks, including web development, system administration, data analysis, and more.

Containers: WSL can be used in conjunction with Docker to develop and run containerized applications on your Windows machine.

Overall, WSL bridges the gap between Windows and Linux, making it easier for users who need to work in both environments or those who prefer a Linux environment for specific tasks while using Windows as their primary operating system. It has gained popularity among developers and system administrators for its versatility and ease of use.
